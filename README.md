# Stock-Market-Price-Prediction
A machine learing model to predict days when a stock's price will go up.

The goal is to predict future stock prices. On days that the stock price goes up, can it be predicted that it will go up.

The model was buiilt using a random forest classifier. Historical stock prices are downloaded from Yahoo finance using the yfinance API.
Precision was used as the accuracy metric of the algorithm.

The jupyterlab notebook contains the steps taken to design, build, test and improve the model in order to achieve the best perfomance.
